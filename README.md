Travel Mapper
===============

SImply little project which allows you to create a simple google map with multiple markers on.

The goal is to allow the markers to be joined with different modes of transport.

If you cant use it locally i.e. fil:/// then try opening a console in the project directory and if you have python installed run this 'python -m SimpleHTTPServer'
